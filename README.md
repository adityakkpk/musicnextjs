# NextJS

A repository in which I have placed all the code which I have written during learning the NextJS framework.

Below is the Track of my learnings

## Day 1 - Introduction to NextJS

* **What**
    - It is a Full Stack Framework. 

* **Requirements/Prerequisites :**
	- Understanding of Javascript
	- Basic React
	- Basic Backend (ExpressJS)

* **Initializing a new NextJS project (musicnextjs)**
    - use the command `npx create-next-app@latest` to initialize a new NextJS app.
    - Input the name of your project
    - Select the plugins you want to install 
    - Run `npm install` command to install all the dependencies and plugins.
    - Use `npm run dev` to run your development server.

* **Understand the code structure**
    - Understand the code structure of NextJS
    - Understand the different files and configuration for the projects.

* *Note:* 
    1. Every folder can have their own Page and Layout File. And sub folders can also do the same.
    2. You can name anything to your folder but inside a folder you must have a `page.tsx/page.jsx`.
